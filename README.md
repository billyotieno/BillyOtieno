👋 Greetings! I'm Otieno, and I'm on a mission to code the world into a better place! 🚀

🧑‍💻 As a Solutions Engineer - Technology, Data & Analytics, I've been bringing my A-game to the tech industry for 7+ years now. I'm passionate about Software Engineering, Data Science & Machine Learning, and I always strive to push the boundaries of what's possible.

🚀 When I'm not coding, you'll find me 🏋🏻‍♀️ Cardio & Lifting, 🕺 Dancing, 📚 Reading or 🥾🏞️🏕🧗🚵 Hicking. I believe in keeping a healthy work-life balance, and nothing energizes me more than being mindful at all times.

📚 I'm a lifelong learner and a tech enthusiast. I'm constantly on the lookout for the latest trends and tools that can help me and my team build better, faster, and more robust software.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving headfirst into Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Graph Neural Networks, MLOps, Generative AI (LLMs) & Analytics, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
